# Caviar Clips Web Application

Caviar Clips is a movie-themed blogging website where people talk film. Anybody can log in and view all of
the blogs. If they like the content, they can choose to sign up, sign in, and start blogging about their thoughts
and opinions about movie topics! The back-end was created using Ruby and Ruby on Rials. The front-end was developed
using JavaScript and jQuery commands to communicate with the Caviar Clips API. Anybody viewing the application
is able to read through any created blog. All accounts and blogs are stored in the back-end API.

## Development process and strategy

The primary focus of this project was being able to create a theme-based blog with a backend
API that would connect to a front end program. Together, they created a smooth, user friendly
application. This was the strategy used to approach this program:
- Test various features using `cURL` scripts
- Use `Ruby on Rails` to create a resource that could connect to and be altered by a user
- Use forms, buttons, and sections in `index.html` to create locations for certain features
- Use `jQuery` to handle the events of specific targets.
- Send API calls to reflect user events and resource events that I created on the backend
- Structure and organize events for each feature
- Display events, text, and animation for the user to interact with on the front end
- Created styling using `SCSS` and `CSS3` to make the app more visually appealing to the user.
