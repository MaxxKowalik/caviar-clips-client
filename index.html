        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
          It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
          making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
          at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
           Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
           the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
           source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
           Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
           BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
           Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
           comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
           since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
           1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in
           their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
           translation by H. Rackham.
